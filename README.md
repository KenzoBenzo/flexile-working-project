# Flexile working project

This is an exploration of what Flexile could feel like with more intention into fluidity.

Specifically of note:

- The `PillTabs` component animates a puck between the active tab
- Layout elements that have expected size changes due to conditional content, are wrapped in an `ExpandableSection` component that cleanly animates between states.
- In the sidebar is a callout of an action we'd like to emphasize in Flexile â€” collaborating with others whether that be hiring a contractor or working for a company. This empty state is meant to exist if there is only one company in the sidebar, and has a subtle svg animation with a bit of humor.
